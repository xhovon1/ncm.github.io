Marketers: Identify which customers are most likely to respond to a campaign.

Hobbyists: Explore the fascinating world of data science with your own fun datasets.

Anyone with a CSV file who has ever asked, "What can this data tell me?"
Core Features (Benefit-Oriented)
ðŸ”¹ Import Your Data Instantly

Effortlessly select and import any CSV file directly from your device's storage. NoCodeML intelligently parses your data, handling both numeric and text-based columns automatically.
ðŸ”¹ Powerful Algorithm Suite

Go beyond simple models. Choose from over 10 industry-standard classification algorithms.

Includes robust tree-based methods like Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Decision Trees, as well as classic models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN.
ðŸ”¹ Fine-Tune Like a Pro (Or Use Smart Defaults)

Each algorithm comes with pre-set, reliable parameters to get you started instantly.

For advanced users, an intuitive UI with sliders allows you to easily adjust key hyperparameters like the number of trees or node sizes to optimize your model's performance.
ðŸ”¹ Trust Your Results with Cross-Validation

No more guessing if your model is accurate. NoCodeML automatically performs a rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, training and testing your model on different slices of your data to provide a reliable measure of its real-world performance.
ðŸ”¹ Build Your Model Library

Every model you train is automatically saved. The "My Models" screen gives you a searchable library of all your projects, complete with their performance metrics (Accuracy, F1 Score, etc.), creation date, and algorithm type.
ðŸ”¹ Make Real-World Predictions

Put your trained models to work! Predict outcomes on new data by either selecting a new CSV file or entering data for a single prediction manually through a simple form.
ðŸ”¹ Take Action on Your Insights

Don't leave your predictions stuck in the app. With a single tap, export your prediction results (your original data plus the new "Predicted_Label" column) to a new CSV file, ready to be shared or analyzed further.
ðŸ”¹ Private & Secure by Design

All data processing, training, and prediction happens 100% on-device. Your CSV files and data never leave your phone, ensuring complete privacy and security.
